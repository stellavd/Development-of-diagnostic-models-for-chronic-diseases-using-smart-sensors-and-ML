# Development of Diagnostic Models for Chronic Diseases Using Smart Sensors and Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to diagnose chronic diseases by leveraging data collected from smart sensors. The objective is to facilitate early detection and monitoring of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney disorders through advanced data analytics and predictive modeling.

## Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning pipelines  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insightful data visualization  
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for classification  
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Deployment-ready code with Docker support

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellavd/Development-of-diagnostic-models-for-chronic-diseases-using-smart-sensors-and-ML.git
cd Development-of-diagnostic-models-for-chronic-diseases-using-smart-sensors-and-ML
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

Ensure your dataset is placed in the `data/` directory. Use the `preprocessing.py` script to clean and preprocess the data.

```bash
python preprocessing.py
```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Generate visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data distribution.

```bash
python eda.py
```

3. **Model Training:**

Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data.

```bash
python main.py
```

4. **Model Inference:**

Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

```bash
python inference.py
```

## Docker Deployment

To containerize the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

```bash
docker build -t chronic-disease-diagnosis .
```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 chronic-disease-diagnosis
```
